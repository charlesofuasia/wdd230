        <h3>Fick's Law</h3>
        <p>FamilySearch</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.familysearch.org" target="_blank"

        <p>
          The familysearch website is a good example of an application of Hick's
          Law which states that the time it takes to make a decision increases
          with the number and complexity of choices. As can be seen from the
          home page, very few buttons are presented and the key button is the
          "Get Started" button. The principle applied here is narrowing the
          choices of the page visitors and and directing the new visitors to get
          started after stating the key objective of the site

        <h3>Visual Hierachy</h3>
        <p>Piggyvest</p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.piggyvest.com/" target="_blank">piggyvest.com</a>
        </p>
        <img
          src="images/piggyvest.jpg"
          alt="A screenshot of piggytvest's website"
        />
        <p>
          The principle identified in the the piggyvest website is the principle
          of Visual Hierachy. The designers of the website used a combination of
          contrast, font size and colors to direct the attention of the viewer
          to where the product or service providers want attention focused. The
          key message "The Better Way to Save and Invest" has the largest font
          and also a good contrast. the next highlited thing that grabs
          attention is the "sign up button". We see here that the designers
          gives hierachy in the order they wish the site visitors to notice
          elements of the site.

        <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>
        <p>Apple</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/ng/" target="_blank">apple.com</a></p>
        <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="A screenshot of apple's website" />
        <p>
          The apple website applied the principle of White Space and Clean
          Design. This priciple draws attention to intended elements in a
          website by making the elements to stand out through maximizing the
          white spaces around the elements. This simply means nothing else is
          near the desired element. As seen in the apple website, the image of
          the mobile phones takes prominence by not adding other items or
          writings that might distract, close to them. This strategy helps the
          site visitors to only focus their attentions on the phones.
